# Fraud-Detection-Project 🔍
Logistic Regression Model using scikit-learn

This project aims to enhance transaction auditing with a Logistic Regression model to detect fraudulent activities 🚨. Designed for seamless integration into automatic workflows and autoflagging systems, this tool efficiently identifies suspicious transactions.

## Features 📊
- **Type of Transaction**
- **Current System Fraud Flag**
- **Transaction Step**
  - *Note: 'Step' represents a unit of time in the transaction process (hours, days, etc.)*
- **Transaction Amount**
- **Old Balance of Origin Account**
- **New Balance of Origin Account**
- **Old Balance of Destination Account**
- **New Balance of Destination Account**

Utilizing One Hot Encoding throughout its process, this model offers a swift and reliable method to flag transactions for further personal inspection. While it may not replace existing systems, it significantly aids in managing large volumes of transactions efficiently 🔄.
